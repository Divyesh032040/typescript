## 🧑‍💻 Concepts Covered

This repository includes code and examples on:

- **Basic Types**: Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Arrays, Tuples, Enums, and more
- **Functions**: Typing, Optional and Default Parameters, Arrow Functions
- **Interfaces and Types**: Differences and use cases for both
- **Classes and Inheritance**: Object-oriented features with examples
- **Advanced Types**: Unions, Intersections, Type Guards, Conditional Types
- **Generics**: Flexible, reusable code for any data type
- **Modules**: Importing and exporting between files
- **TypeScript with JavaScript**: Working with JavaScript libraries

## 📝 Sample Code

Here’s a quick look at one of my TypeScript snippets from this repo:

```typescript
// interfaces example
interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    location?: string;
}

const user: User = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 25,
};

console.log(`Hello, ${user.name}!`);
```

This snippet demonstrates **optional properties** and **typing** in TypeScript.

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

To run the code examples, make sure you have TypeScript installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

To compile any `.ts` file to JavaScript, use:

```bash
tsc filename.ts
```

Alternatively, run the code directly with:

```bash
ts-node filename.ts
```
