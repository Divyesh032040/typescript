// UNION TYPE : The first way to combine types you might see is a union type. A union type is a type formed from two or more other types, representing values that may be any one of those types. We refer to each of these types as the unionâ€™s members.
function createUser(user) {
    return {
        name: user.name,
        age: user.age,
        email: user.email
    };
}
console.log(createUser({ name: "divyesh", age: 21, email: "dp032040@gmail.com" }));
